Many and various are the Opinions
about the Design, as
well as about the Meaning and
real and true Sense of the short
Discourse lately writ by the
Celebrated Dr. <i>Mead</i>, for preventing
the Plague. The various Turns of
the Heads of different Men, their different
Capacities, and the Sublimity of the Doctor’s
Style may, no doubt, occasion all this Variety
in understanding Him and his Book. Some,
and if we may judge by the great Run and
Demand for his Book, the greatest Number
of the People of all Ranks expected some <i>Esculapian</i>,
but easy Rules, whereby they might
govern and conduct their Life against so silent
an Enemy as the Pestilence, which walketh
in Darkness. This seems to be more than a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span><i>Conjecture</i>, because this great Demand ceas’d
of a sudden, as the Plague it self commonly
does, after they found the Physician had no
hand in it, or that his Rules were locked up
for the Favourites of his Faculty. And as the
People commonly make the best Judgment of
Things after a little Experience, so we find
this Judgment of the Town confirmed, by
what his <i>Friends</i>, <i>Adepts</i>, and other <i>Officers</i>,
who only understand or declare what Dr.
<i>Mead</i> would have believed; and accordingly
they labour to declare, that the genuine
Meaning and Design of the Celebrated Doctor
was, to give a Politick Account, how
the Plague may be staved off by Force of
Arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>I grant this Authority is very cogent; yet,
on the other hand, if we either consider the
Title Page of the Book, the great Accurateness
and Veracity of Dr. <i>Mead</i>, as well as his
signal <i>Humility</i>, I must crave leave to dissent,
at this time, from the Reports of these Men,
tho’ they carry his daily and hourly Orders:
for how do such Reports sute all those his
known good Qualities, the last more especially.
Can any Man think it consistent with his
singular Humility, to teach the Secretary of
State, what has been practised in our own
and other Countries for some hundred of
Years: <i>Quarantines and Pest-Houses</i>, or if the
Doctor pleases, <i>Lazarettoes</i>, are not unknown
to English Lawyers, nor English Ministers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>And therefore I think it much the fairest
Course, to consider the Discourse well, because
it is short, and from thence to draw the
Sense of its Author.</p>

<p class='c006'>To do all imaginable Right to Dr. <i>Mead</i>,
we will begin with the Title-Page, that nothing
material may seem to be neglected.
There we find it is to be a Discourse concerning
<i>Pestilential</i> Contagion, and Methods to
prevent it. Turning next to the Dedication,
he tells his Patron that he rather chuses to <i>put
down the principal Heads of Caution, than a
Set of Directions in Form</i>. This Head he
seems to suggest chiefly to consist in performing
Quarantines, and other things that may
be collected from History. The next (Head
I suppose) is concerning the <i>suppressing Infection
here</i>; which he tells us is <i>very different from
the Methods taken in former times among us,
and from what they commonly do abroad; but</i>
(as he very modestly perswades himself) <i>will
be found agreeable to Reason</i>. This Account
differs very much from the Rumours and Opinions
now prevailing in the World; for we
are to be entertain’d with a preventing Method,
as far as Physick and Politicks extend,
and on that Account cannot fail to be very
new when finished; because all former Accounts
are very defective, the silent Attacks
of the Pestilence having been hitherto undiscover’d
by all former Physicians. And therefore
is there any Person so hard-hearted, or so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>stupid, that does not rejoyce and prick up his
Ears at those ravishing Expressions, who does
not desire to be instructed in this Method of
preventing this unmerciful Enemy to Mankind.
Come on then, and listen to the Celebrated
Dr. <i>Mead</i>, who brings Death to Pestilential
Contagion; as he is said to have
promis’d while he was composing this Work.
But we will next follow Dr. <i>Mead</i> into the
Book it self, where we find that he thinks it
<i>necessary to premise somewhat in general concerning
Contagion, and the Manner by which
it acts</i>. But alas! we are to meet with nothing
but Disappointments, so soon are we
fallen from all our Hopes and Expectations:
Nothing to be found either of <i>Contagion</i>, or
the manner of its acting, tho’ the Title of
the Book promises it, and the first entring upon
the Discourse declares it to be necessary;
This is the very Soul of the Book, the subject
Matter upon which every thing turns, the
Cause of the Plague, and the Indication for
preventing and curing the Plague, are to be
drawn out of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides, the most ancient and best Physicians
knew nothing of Contagion, and far less
of <i>Pestilential Contagion</i>; Words only brought
in by Physicians in later times, and of Ignorance;
and therefore such suspected Words
ought to be well described and defined before
they are made use of; either in discovering
the Nature of abstruse Diseases, or when we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>are to found Methods of preventing or curing
them, upon such Discoveries.</p>

<p class='c006'>To leave this Enquiry about Contagion to
another Occasion, we will only observe, that
this necessary Article is overseen and neglected
by the Accurate Dr. <i>Mead</i>, for Reasons well
known to himself, and easily to be guessed at
by every body. It must be acknowledg’d that
the Doctor’s way of writing and inquiring is
very singular, the remaining part of his Book
being carried on without Principles, or any
known thing with which his Subject to be explained
has any relation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, as I have now undertaken to make
this short Discourse more intelligible, I will
pursue my Design in Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Method, as
far as that does not obscure the Subject: In
that Case I will take the Liberty to keep the
Thread of our Discourse as much in our view
is it is possible. Dr. <i>Mead</i> then having taken
leave of <i>Contagion</i>, tells us, that this unknown
<i>Contagion is propagated by three Causes, The
Air, diseased Persons, and Goods transported
from infected Places</i>. What a propagating
Cause may be, shall be left to those that deal
in Metaphysicks, to determine; it matters
not what it appears to be, while the begetting
Cause is unknown.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to Air, he now undertakes to shew us
how it becomes <i>Infectious, and how it communicates
its noxious Quality to other Bodies</i>.
The first, by the Authority of <i>Hippocrates</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><i>Galen</i>; but in this he mistakes his Authors,
as he commonly does when they do not come
up to his Purpose; for <i>Hippocrates</i> is thought,
by many Authors, not to treat of the Plague,
in this third Book of his Epidemicks; <i>Galen</i>,
in the Commentary quoted by Dr. <i>Mead</i>, is
so far from thinking that <i>Hippocrates</i> was resolved
to give us Cases of the Plague, that
he thought quite otherwise: And for the
Truth of this Assertion, take an irrefragable
Authority, <i>instar omnium</i>, the learned Dr.
<i>Friend</i>, who says at the Remark <a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c007'><sup>[1]</sup></a>Λοιμωδης<i>,
hic non est proprie pestilens &amp; contagiosus, siquidem
in his morbis ab Hippocrate descriptis,
nullum est contagii vestigium: Sed ut Galenus
innuit aliud non est, quam </i>Επιδημια ὀλέθριος.
And a little after, <i>sed ipse titulus Galeno paululum
suspectus est</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>We will not insist upon this Sense of <i>Hippocrates</i>;
but suppose he there truly treats of
the Plague, and that he has observed such a
Temperament of Air to have preceded it,
what is this to Contagion and Infection, which
neither <i>Hippocrates</i> nor <i>Galen</i> ever dream’d
of. Besides, <i>Hippocrates</i> calls the Plague a
Fever, and in his Opinion several Affections
of Air, to him, and us, perhaps, unknown,
produced Plagues, or Fevers (for these Words
are synonimous with him) and the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Part of other Diseases. So that it is manifest
from <i>Hippocrates</i>, that this, and many other
Alterations of the Air do not make it <i>Infectious</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following Paragraph is of no Force,
after what is now said concerning <i>Hippocrates</i>;
the best Historian, that is not a Physician,
is never presumed to go beyond an
Account and Relation of Matter of Fact, as
he apprehends it; and so far went the great
<i>Thucydides</i>, in relating the Plague of <i>Athens</i>.
We will rather consider what the Doctor alledges
for strengthning his Conjecture about
Contagion. <a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c007'><sup>[2]</sup></a><i>Stinks of stagnating Waters,
in hot Weather; putrid Exhalations from the
Earth; and above all, the Corruption of dead
Carcasses being unburied, have occasion’d infectious
Diseases.</i> Let us now suppose this
Account to be true, yet his chief Article about
Carcasses is absolutely false, as may be
prov’d by one of the best Physicians in any
Age; what is all this to Contagion breeding
the Plague: For suppose again, some or all
of them occasion’d <i>infectious</i> Diseases, the
Consequence is not, <i>Ergo</i>, the Plague; there
being many contagious Diseases that are neither
<i>Plague</i> nor Mortal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet, as if all this were Demonstration, he
asserts, That the Plague is produced by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><i>Concurrence</i> of Causes; <i>and their first Effect is
a Degree of Stagnation in the Air</i>, which is
follow’d by <i>Corruption</i>, and Putrefaction. It
is needless to enter upon this Hint of a new
<i>Hypothesis</i>; for if his Machine of Contagion,
or Infection, be good, these are unnecessary.
But alas! the celebrated Doctor has, in the
Conclusion, destroy’d the whole Fabrick he
had rear’d with so much Trouble, after he
had borrow’d Brick from one, Mortar from
another, and Timber from a third; and only
because he became, against Nature and
his own Genius, a Master-Builder. Is a Concurrence
of all the supposed Causes necessary
to make a Plague? Then there never was a
Plague in the World; and that because these
Causes never all met together: A hopeful
Conclusion! and which at once delivers the
World of insufferable Fears, they hitherto
groan’d under, by a vulgar Error; which is
now contrary to Experience, because it is so to
Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Reasoning.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Hippocrates</i>, on the other Hand, undertakes
only to relate the Constitution of the
Year when <i>Plagues</i> and <i>Fevers</i> were very frequent;
he never thought of making any
particular Constitution, or the Weather in it,
the Cause of Plagues universally: If he had,
Experience should have shewn the contrary,
to which he would have submitted. But not
to enter into any other Constitutions that
might happen in <i>Greece</i>, Experience cries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>loudly against this <i>Hypothesis</i> of Dr. <i>Mead</i>;
since we know that <i>hard</i> and <i>continued frosty</i>
Weather produces the Pestilence, most commonly,
in our Northern Climates. The Winter
1664, was a continued Frost all through,
as Dr. <i>Hodges</i> informs us; yet the Plague
broke out in the <i>Christmas</i> time, when it was
in its <i>Strength</i>. The Plague in <i>Dantzick</i>,
mention’d by Dr. <i>Mead</i>, was in the Winter,
when every thing was bound up with a severe
<i>Frost</i>; yet so violent was this Plague, that it
bred the <i>Dunkirk-Fever</i> in the Fag-end of it,
as Dr. <i>Mead</i> learnedly conjectures. So that
the Pestilence frequently, and most commonly,
happens in a Season very opposite to what
the Doctor finds necessary for breeding <i>Infection
and Corruption</i>, the <i>Fore-runners</i> of a
Plague.</p>

<p class='c006'>From all this Account it is manifest, that
we hitherto know nothing of <i>Contagion</i>, nor
of any Corruption convey’d into Air, which
it is to foment and cherish, to beget or propagate
the Pestilence; as also that this Notion
of Contagion taken up and espoused by later
Physicians, is very ill supported by them, and
still worse by Dr. <i>Mead</i>, who is little acquainted
with their Opinions, so common and obvious
in Books of Physick. And therefore as
he has been very unhappy in discovering the
<i>Change</i> in Air that makes it infectious; we
will try for better Success, in his discovering
the <i>Means</i>, whereby it <i>communicates its noxious
Quality to other Bodies</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>In order to pursue this Discourse with greater
Exactness, it is necessary to ease our Memory
from carrying the different Particulars
of seven Pages, and not to oblige the Reader
to take, on trust, what is writ so long before.
It may, perhaps, be useful to Dr. <i>Mead</i> to tell
us<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c007'><sup>[3]</sup></a>, that he, lately, left the <i>Air in a putrid
State</i>; but that is nothing to us, who are at
this present time sensible that the Doctor has
not been able to bring the least Speck of Putrefaction
into it. However, not to balk him in
his projected Means, whereby it communicates
its noxious Quality; he desires us to observe,
that <i>Putrefaction is a kind of Fermentation,
and that all Bodies in a Ferment emit a
volatile active Spirit, of Power to agitate, and
put into intestine Motions, that is, to change the
Nature of other Fluids, into which it insinuates
it self</i>. Now we have observed it, we find
every Article of this Observation to be false;
for Putrefaction does not always precede Fermentation,
nor that every body in a Ferment
emits volatile Spirits, nor that volatile Spirits
have a Power to agitate, or to put into intestine
Motions all Liquors into which they insinuate
themselves; and still far less, that being
put into intestine Motions, is to change
the Nature of the Fluid thus put in Motion.
What Use the Doctor may have for this Roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of precarious Assertions, time may tell us: for
he has now got the Master-Key of all Philosophy,
even <i>Fermentation</i>, into his Hand. By
Fermentation <i>Stones</i>, <i>Metals</i>, <i>Plants</i>, <i>Animals</i>,
and (if it pleases him) the <i>Pestilence</i>,
are generated, and cherished. This makes
Diseases; this cures them; by this we live, by
this we die.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither does this Machine only answer all
our Wants in performing the greater, but even
the smaller feats, as we chance to employ
it: for if we are asked, why <i>Glow-birds</i> shine
in the Night? or why <i>wet Hay</i> takes Fire of
it self, <i>&amp;c.</i> one short Answer is sufficient to
all these, that these great Works are done by
<i>Fermentation</i>. A Poet in ancient times, pronounced
those Nations happy, that had their
rural Gods growing in their Gardens. But I
esteem the Man far more happy, who has at
hand so ready an Answer to every thing: who
has got a Machine equally serviceable on every
occasion, the <i>Philosopher’s Stone</i>, the <i>universal
Medicine</i>, the making a Plague.</p>

<p class='c006'>Being thus possessed of this useful Machine,
he tells us what wonderful feats he could perform
by it, with the Help of <i>Bellini</i>’s Doctrine
of Fevers, if he had any time to bestow
on so <i>great a Digression</i>: for he could shew
us, <i>how the Alterations made in the Blood will
favour Pestilential Diseases, by rendering the
Body obnoxious to them</i>. Why, this is the Favour
we have waited for in eleven tedious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Pages; and if he writes in English, we may
thus be taught how the Blood is affected in
Pestilential Diseases, by laying us a-bed languishing
with them. This would not only be
one step towards Contagion, as he artfully begins
the next Paragraph, but might fully inform
us of every thing we want to know concerning
it. Why should the Great and Celebrated
Dr. <i>Mead</i> call this a Digression? I wish
he would begin thus to digress: but it is now
too late, since he has already digressed from
all his Title-Page, and the half of his Preface.
<i>Contagion</i> was dropt at first, and now we find
that <i>Pestilential Contagion</i> has no better Fate.
How <i>preventing</i> may thrive under his Hands,
is not hard to guess, since he knows nothing
of what he promises to prevent. These <i>Methods
are very different from those taken in former
times among us, and from what they commonly
do abroad</i>. Insomuch, that had any
body writ in this Method, besides the Celebrated
Doctor, I should have thought him
the most ignorant, impertinent, and self-sufficient
Person that ever made a Sale of Physick.</p>

<p class='c006'>What Account can he give to Physicians,
for thus despising the received Opinions of
<i>Hippocrates</i>, and of all their learned and experienc’d
Predecessors, who unanimously declare,
that the Plague differs in nothing from
a Fever; or else that a Fever attends every
Plague of Pestilence. And, therefore, in
him is all Physick, or else he knows nothing
of it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Nay, how can he answer it to himself, who
in his Manifesto, in the very next Paragraph,
is under an unavoidable Want of a Fever he
formerly neglected. Here he tells us a Tale,
That, <i>the next</i> (Step towards Contagion,
and it is not safe to go too near it) <i>as it seems
to me, proceeds after this Manner</i>. This kind
of introductory Humility has been very fashionable,
of late, among dignify’d Authors;
for in advancing a Proposition, whereof they
can bring no Proof, it is not to be thought
how humble, how self-deny’d they are in that
Instant; but they <i>rant</i>, <i>swagger</i>, and <i>bully</i>, if
they get their Reader but Three Lines further.
So this celebrated Author, after this
humble Cringe, tells us, <i>The Blood in all malignant
Fevers, especially pestilential ones</i> (to
be sure) <i>at the latter End of the Disease, does,
like fermenting Liquors, throw off a great Quantity
of active Particles upon the several Glands
of the Body, particularly upon those of the
Mouth and Skin, from which the Secretions are
naturally the most constant and large. These,
in pestilential Cases, although the Air be in a
right State, will generally infect those who are
very near to the sick Person; otherwise are
soon dispersed and lost.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The first Part of this Declaration, if my
Memory fails me not, is taken from the
Doctor’s elaborate Essay on Poisons; and is
brought forth with all its primitive Elegance,
for the present Purpose; but by no means answers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>his Want of it: For it does not appear,
by <i>any manner of Observation</i>, that the Blood
throws off any active Particles at the latter
End of <i>malignant</i> Fevers, <i>so there is no need to
have Recourse to this</i> Supposition. But why
upon any Glands? This Expression does not
favour of understanding <i>Anatomy</i>. Why upon
the Glands of the Mouth? Surely this
Supposition is not of any Use in this Place,
however serviceable it might prove in the
mentioned Book, when the <i>Slabbering</i> of a
mad Dog was upon the Anvil. Moreover, Is
Secretion most constantly performed at the
Glands of the Mouth and of the Skin? Surely
not, as <i>Sanctorius</i> evinces, and is evident
from the Doctrine of Secretions, perfectly
well explain’d many Years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next, let us suppose that this is Standard
Physick, as it is quite the Reverse of it; what
mighty matter is to be drawn from it? Why,
these active Particles, tho’ the Air be pure,
<i>will infect those who are very near to the sick
Person; otherwise are soon dispersed and lost</i>.
I hope there is no harm in the last, and there
is no Proof alledg’d for the former. So that
his next Step towards Contagion, does not
proceed at all. I cannot tell how well he manages
in the remaining Part of the Paragraph;
and therefore I will only set it in View, that
any Person of a more enlighten’d Understanding
than my self may profit by the Doctor’s
own Words. <i>But when in an evil Disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of this they meet with these subtle Parts its
Corruption has generated, by uniting with them,
they become much more active and powerful, and
likewise more durable and lasting, so as to form
an infectious Matter, capable of conveying the
Mischief to a great Distance from the diseased
Body, out of which it was produced.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Now if Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Narration is to the
Purpose, it goes further than he design’d it
should; for how are the active Particles, like
fermented Liquors, thrown out of the Blood
in the latter End of malignant Fevers, and
that in so great Plenty, and of so great Energy,
that they themselves had been able to
have helped to his next Step of Contagion, if
he had not luckily interposed with a saving
Clause, <i>especially pestilential ones</i>, whereby
the last would have been deprived of all the
Honour of making Contagion: But what is
still worse, Fevers, especially those that are
malignant, are now the chief Article in this
Account, and leave Dr. <i>Mead</i> inexcusable, for
not applying Almighty <i>Fermentation</i> to the
learned <i>Bellini</i>’s Theory of Fevers. And
here let it be observ’d, That those pestilential
Steams go no great Length, ’till they are enabled
by the next, unintelligible Means,
whereby is formed an infectious Matter capable
of conveying the Mischief to a great
Distance. I hope Doctor <i>Mead</i> understands
his last Words; for my Part, I do not, and
by the next Paragraph I find my self still more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>unqualify’d to receive his Story of Contagion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The former Piece of Knowledge is open to
those only who are the familiar Friends of
<i>Attractions</i> and <i>Combinations</i> made by Volatile
Spirits; and we who are Strangers to these
powerful Words, cannot hope for any Instruction.
But to shew Dr. <i>Mead</i> I have been at
true Pains to come acquainted with them, I
find there was Old Attraction, Son of <i>Aristotle</i>;
and there is Young Attraction, the
great Geometrician; and a Counterfeit of
this in the Works of the celebrated Doctor
<i>Anodyne Necklace</i>; which last is mighty like
Attraction before us; but as he is spurious,
I must own that I do not find how this Attraction
brings me to a clearer Understanding
of the foregoing Paragraph. As to Combination,
whether that of Cooks, or Algebraists, it
is of very little or no Use to me. I must confess,
a good Use may be made of these Words; for
they will exchange with <i>Fermentation</i>, at any
Time that an Author finds himself disposed to
write on a Subject without understanding it.</p>

<p class='c006'>For Instance, I now intend to make a short
Discourse about the <i>Philosopher’s Stone</i>, and a
Method for finding it; a very agreeable Offer
to the Publick, when Money is scarce,
and Credit very low, through the great Industry
of the ingenious Directors of the <i>South
Sea</i>. When, I say, a Man forms to himself
this useful Project, <i>Attraction</i> and <i>Combination</i>
does it at once. The Receipt is easy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>it is but taking of <i>Attraction</i>, <i>Circulation</i>,
<i>Cohobation</i>, <i>Concentration</i>, <i>a. q. s. Combination</i>,
<i>q. s. M.</i> If this Receipt is duly managed,
it will not only make the <i>Philosopher’s
Stone</i>, and the grand <i>Elixir</i>, but cures the
Plague, and all Diseases, <i>Curable</i> or <i>Incurable</i>.
But it is to be noted, that when you
would explain how Attraction makes a Plague,
you must be sure due Consideration be had
to the Facility and Aptness of <i>all kind of Effluvia
to be diffused in a warm Air, such as we
have described an infectious one to be</i>. And,
therefore, as the Whole of Infecting Air is
an ill-made Story, supported by Cant and
Gibberish, we will take Leave of it, and his
mortify’d Limb together, tho’ it is brought
to give further Light to this strange Stuff.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, to proceed, the celebrated Doctor
smells a Rat; that unless the Air is allowed a
greater Share of shedding Destruction than
he has hitherto allotted it, Matters may go
very hard with the whole Doctrine of <i>Contagion</i>;
and therefore, notwithstanding its being
a Medium for propagating <i>Contagion</i> only,
the Doctor is now willing to pronounce,
with full Power, and for Fear of great Inconveniencies
that follow close at the Heels of
the former Doctrine, that <i>a corrupted State of
Air is </i><span class='sc'>without Doubt necessary</span><i> to give
these contagious Atoms their full Force; for
otherwise it is not easy to conceive how the
Plague should ever cease, but with the Destruction</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of all the Inhabitants. Here is a Devil
raised indeed, and he will not be in the
least quieted, unless Dr. <i>Mead</i> will contradict
himself, and renounce the half of his Defence,
for the <i>Pureness</i> and <i>Uncorruptedness</i> of Air.
And what will not a Man do for a quiet Life.
And even the <i>English</i> Air, that could formerly
kill the greatest Plague, is now without
doubt under a State of Corruption: For if that
is not admitted, God have Mercy on all <i>English</i>
Men. This is very kind in the Doctor,
to take shame to himself for the Good of his
Country.</p>

<p class='c006'>Conveniency is a pretty Argument, but not
very cogent, as we now see; for this corrupted
State of Air is only an Expedient to get
rid of a Pestilence; because by <span class='sc'>Supposing</span>
<i>an Emendation of the Qualities of the Air, and
restoring of it to a healthy State, capable of dissipating
and suppressing the Malignity</i>, we put
an end to the Plague in an instant. Mighty
fine, and <i>Meadish</i>; tho’ he might have put a
stop to a Plague at an easier rate, than the
Loss of his Hypothesis; for as the stress of the
Expedient rests upon another fine Word, <i>supposing</i>;
why, he needed only to suppose that
the whole Magazine of Poison is stopped at
once, it matters not whether that be by an
Army, by making it serve a <i>Quarantine</i>, by
an <i>Amulet</i>, or that the raw Damp is again
attracted by the Sea. I hope due Consideration
will be had to this Expedient, in a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Edition of <i>the short Discourse</i>; if so be it has
one. This would do much better than to
make another Drawback, which we find is
done in the very next Paragraph; for there,
<i>Infection is not received from the Air it self,
however predisposed, without the Concurrence
of something emitted from infected Persons</i>.
Now if Infection is never receiv’d from the
Air upon any Account whatsoever, it is manifest,
that the Air is a <i>Medium</i>, that can neither
do Good nor Hurt, and so to the right about,
and the former Allowance is recalled;
so that the former Difficulty still remains, and
consequently a Plague once begun in a Country,
never comes to an end, as long as there is
a Man alive.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Principle upon which this Resumption
is made, is, because the Progress of a Pestilence
may be stopt at any time, <i>by strictly preventing
all Intercourse of infected Places with
the Neighbourhood</i>. He brings as a Proof of
this lusty Assertion, what has lately happened
in the raging Plague at <i>Marseilles</i>; and alledges,
that it has been effectually confined to
that miserable Town, by keeping careful
Guard. But alas! this Argument is out of
doors. Happy were it for the People of <i>France</i>
if they had greater Assurance of their Safety,
than they can draw from such vain Promises
of Insuring Physicians. And therefore his
Objection remains in full Force, without any
Satisfaction being given to it. I know from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>whence he took this Difficulty, but he ought
to have been well satisfied that he had brought
a full Solution to so powerful an Argument against
all manner of <i>Contagion</i>. I will only
repeat the Difficulty, and leave the clearing
of it to the Patrons of a Pestilence being begot
by <i>Contagion</i>; especially that it is a Step
towards Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s next propagating Cause.
It is asserted by those who oppose this <i>Contagion</i>,
that a Plague is sometimes bred without
it, otherwise it would be perpetual. This
Assertion is made good, by considering a
Country where a new Plague is broken out;
and ask us, whether it be just then bred in
that Country, or brought thither from elsewhere?
If we grant the first, then indeed adieu
to all <i>Contagion</i>: If the last, they bid us
name the originary Place, where it was bred:
Which would oblige us to the same Concession
as the former. Therefore, say they, <i>Contagion</i>
may <i>propagate</i> but not <i>begin</i> a Plague.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaving then Doctor <i>Mead</i> and his <i>Contagion</i>
under the Restraint of a very good Argument,
we will consider in the next Place,
after what manner he conveys it to a sound
Person, and he <i>supposes</i> the way to be commonly
this: <i>These contagious Particles—taint
the salival Juices</i> (or Spittle) which being
<i>swallowed down into the Stomach, presently
fix their Malignity there</i>; as appears from <i>the
Nausea and Vomiting, with which this Distemper
often begins its first Attacks</i>. But all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>is acknowledged to be a Supposition, and not
of sufficient Strength to bear so weighty a
Building upon it. <i>Secondly</i>, If a Man does
nor swallow his Spittle, or if he gargles his
Throat very well before he does swallow it,
there would be no danger from the <i>Pestilence</i>;
but this slye Plague should be easily evaded.
To what Purpose is this silly Supposition to
bring it into the Stomach, and then to suppose
it <i>fixes its Malignity there</i>, because People
are often troubled with Vomiting when
they are ill of the Plague. An admirable
Way of Reasoning: and as Admiration begat
Philosophy, so Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Philosophy cannot
fail of begetting Admiration: For if the Stomach
must needs be the first Place affected by
the Plague, and the Doctor is gone over to
<i>Van Helmont</i>, cannot he convey it thither down
by the Nose, or even through the Mouth,
without infecting the Spittle.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. <i>Mead</i> is grosly out in his Observation,
for the Symptoms of the <i>Heart</i>, our <i>Strength</i>
at least, being affected, are previous to his
supposed <i>Nausea</i> and Vomiting; so that he
not only ought <i>to make no Question</i>, but to be
sure that the <i>Blood is also more immediately affected</i>;
as the Multitude of Physicians besides
<i>Van Helmont</i> and him have always believed:
But I find his Fancy lies much in odd Conceits.
I know a very honest Man, and a good
Observer in Physick, who has fallen into this
very Error in explaining this Symptom of <i>Vomiting</i>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>but every Body will acknowledge
that his Philosophy is no where the best: And
when this Symptom is truly explained, we
shall find that it is a Symptom of a <i>Malignant
Fever</i>, as well as of the Plague, without any
manner of Irritation, or of any other Hurt of
that Nature, in the Stomach. And therefore
as this Way of conveying the Plague, is a Supposition
grounded upon no manner of Observation
(as the Doctor argues in this Paragraph)
so I think there is no need to have recourse
to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other Hand, it might be demonstrated,
from the Nature of the Plague, that it is
never, or very rarely, communicated from
one Person to another. At present we will
content our selves, to evince this Truth by a
Demonstration of another kind, which is from
Observation, or <i>à posteriori</i>, and I will borrow
it too from Mr. <i>Graunt</i>, in his Observations
on the Bills of Mortality. In his Observations
on the <a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c007'><sup>[4]</sup></a>Plague of 1636: He says it lasted 12
Years, in eight whereof there died 2000 <i>per
Annum</i> one with another, and never under
800. The which shews, <i>That the Contagion
of the Plague depends more upon the </i><span class='sc'>Disposition</span><i>
of the Air, than upon the </i><span class='sc'>Effluvia</span><i>
from the Bodies of Men</i>. Which also we prove
by the sudden jumps which the Plague hath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>made, leaping in one Week from 118 to 927;
and back again, from 993 to 258; and from
thence again, the very next Week, to 852.
The which Effects must surely be rather attributed
to <i>Change</i> of the <i>Air</i>, than of the <i>Constitutions</i>
of <i>Mens Bodies</i>, otherwise than as
this depends upon that.</p>

<p class='c006'>And therefore as this very common Opinion,
about the <i>Plague</i> of <i>Pestilence</i> passing from
one Body into another, is not supported by
any good Reason, far less by the <i>Suppositions</i>
and <i>Innuendo’s</i> of Dr. <i>Mead</i>; and is now contrary
to the best Observation, most duly and
properly made, we may not doubt to declare,
that it very rarely, and perhaps never, proceeds
that Way.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Third</i> Way Contagion is spread, is, <i>by
Goods transported from infected Places</i>. But the
Reason of this Fact seems to surmount his Understanding,
and no wonder, for it has already
puzzled all other Philosophers and Physicians,
insomuch, that it has driven them into absurd
Notions of <i>Maggots</i>, against all Observation.
But, before a Philosopher would spend his
Time about this Difficulty, he should be sure
his Fact is indisputably true, for thereby he
may save himself much Trouble and Babling,
about a Matter that is false in Fact. However,
this Difficulty may have blunted the
Edge of every other Genius, he makes no
doubt to conquer it, and account for it to the
World, as he now does in the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Words: <i>If, as we have conjectured, the Matter
of Contagion be an active Substance, perhaps
in the nature of a Salt, generated chiefly
from the Corruption of a Human Body, it is not
hard to conceive how this may be lodged and
preserv’d in soft porous Bodies, which are kept
pressed close together.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. <i>Mead</i> has the readiest Way of getting
rid of a Difficulty, of any Author, tho’ I cannot
say it is always the most informing and
perswasive. No Man that understands these
Terms, <i>a Salt</i>, what it is to be <i>soft</i> and <i>porous</i>,
dares keep back his Assent to a Proof <i>grounded
upon such manifest Observations</i>, as <i>Conjectures</i>,
<i>Perhaps’s</i>, and <i>May-bee’s</i>; all which are far
more ingenious than <i>Kircher</i>’s Maggots-Eggs.
However bold this Argument may be, yet if
any one will deny his Matter of <i>Contagion</i> to
be an active Substance; or, that it is a Salt;
or, that it rather affects a <i>soft</i> Bed than one
that is <i>hard</i>, this <i>Third</i>, and last <i>propagating
Cause</i>, may prove to be no manner of Cause;
and all the World, Merchants especially, cry out
against their Merchandize serving <i>Quarantine</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Could Dr. <i>Mead</i> bring all his ordinary
Vouchers, I cannot say how far he might have
gone in commanding a Submission from a
great Number of Men to this Article: And
therefore if any Person, or Persons, wants fuller
Conviction, let him repair to the <i>Coffee-Houses</i>,
where they shall have the Affidavits
of ten Physicians, fifteen Apothecaries, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>five Surgeons; and I’ll answer for it, eight
in ten shall go, <i>from </i>Batson<i>’s especially</i>, fully
satisfied with the Truth of the Premises. But
can it be imagined this cunning Doctor would
have expos’d his Character, in this Kind of
Argument, to Men of Learning and Virtue.
But here his drooping Spirits revert, and his
<i>Humility</i> and <i>Modesty</i> vanish, having at this
Stage got rid of the Necessity of Reasoning,
the rest of this inimitable Work being to be
carry’d on by Banter and Assertion; whereby
let us take Measure of the Faith and Credulity
of the good People of <i>England</i>; for if this
passes, <i>Transubstantiation may be the next Article
he will propose to you</i>; if it does not, the
Doctor and his Book are discovered at the
same Time.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we are prepared for all Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s <i>Absurdities</i>,
<i>Wit</i> and <i>Banter</i>, the first Thing he
presents us with, <i>how long a Time Perfumes
hold their Scent, if wrapt up in proper Coverings</i>;
and we must remark, <i>That the strongest
of those, like the Matter we are treating of
(are mostly animal </i>Juices<i>)</i> as Musk, Civet,
<i>&amp;c.</i> (if there be any more.) And the Substances
that keep them the best, are those
which receive and communicate the Plague,
as <i>Furs</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Silk</i>, <i>Hair</i>, <i>Wool</i>, <i>Cotton</i>,
<i>Flax</i>, &amp;c. <i>the greatest part of which are likewise
of the animal Kind</i>. If the <i>Pestilence</i> is
now a <i>Scent</i>, yet surely it is a Noisome one; and
if it can be kept, like <i>Musk</i>, in its proper Covering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>fourty Days will never deliver us from
our fears of it. But all this is only to amuse us
with another new Conceit the Doctor would
entertain us with, that the Matter of the
Plague is an <i>animal Juice</i>; but pray, good
Doctor, of what Animal? This is not only
ridiculous, but overthrows every Opinion of
Physicians that ever was broached about it.
But not to baulk his Wit, this Perfume of the
Plague, like Musk, is best kept in animal
Substances; (<i>Attraction</i> would have preceded
very decently, for a more proper Introduction)
but is Musk, commonly kept in Furs or Cotton;
if in the last, what Animal is it that
yields us Cotton? As for <i>Civet</i> it is no runaway
Merchandize. It is therefore very obvious,
that Men are now passing a Review
of their Credulity before Dr. <i>Mead</i> and the
World. But there is another quaint Observation
that must not be neglected, which is,
That of all the mentioned Plague-Keepers,
Three of them are animal Substances, and
but Two of them of the vegetable Kind.
Mighty fine! and well order’d: But if we
turn to another Page of his <a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c007'><sup>[5]</sup></a>Book, we may
find this useful Observation contradicted: <i>But
the greatest Danger from Goods</i>, is from <i>Cotton</i>,
<i>Hemp</i>, and <i>Flax</i>; <i>Paper</i>, or <i>Books</i> (Paper
Books surely, or else their covering will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>keep them upon an Equality in ballancing Accompts)
<i>Silk</i>, <i>Linnen</i>, <i>Wool</i>, <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Hair</i>,
and <i>Skins</i>. In this Account, the vegetable
and animal Plague-Keepers are equal in Number.</p>

<p class='c006'>What Purposes does this Conceit serve?
Why, only to support another Conceit, <i>viz.</i>
That animal Substances most vigorously attract
animal Effluvia, or that animal Effluvia
run furiously into the Embraces of animal
Substances; which we see by his fine Experiments,
is a mere Fancy. As for <i>Musk</i>, <i>Cotton</i>
secures it the fastest from running away;
nor do we find that <i>Feathers</i>, <i>Silk</i> or <i>Wool</i>,
are ever put upon that Service. But supposing
every Thing true, and nothing whimsical,
that has been now advanced by the
Doctor, we might have expected a further
Discovery; how these Perfumes come to desire
their being beded, cherished, or fomented
in soft animal Substances: Is it in Abhorrence
of Annihilation, or by the Love they bear to
one another? Or are they kept together, as
the celebrated <i>Jonathan Wild</i> keeps a Felon?
In short, is it by <i>Sympathy</i> or <i>Antipathy</i>?
For if we are rightly instructed in these Matters,
<i>these Remarks alone may lead us into</i>
great and useful Practices; for if they are
skilfully employ’d, they may, perhaps, as I
conjecture, keep the Plague at bay, by being
strung up, like Pirates, at High Water Mark.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>For as dull as these Conceits may appear to
be; such as never dropp’d before from any
Man in his Senses; yet our Author, who has
hitherto shewn himself Blind in every kind of
Argument, is now become so Sharp-sighted
of a sudden, when you are to take his Word
for it, that he boldly asserts, That this <i>Remark
alone</i> (of Sympathy and Antipathy) <i>may
serve to lead us a little into the true Nature of
Contagion</i>. What! this Nature of Contagion,
that is still unknown, after all Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Endeavours;
nay, <i>Sweats</i> and <i>Labours</i>, to be
drawn at length from Trifles that bear no Relation
to Contagion.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is no Accounting for this Attempt
upon Mankind: The Doctor, I doubt not,
has often made Trial, how far their good
Nature could carry their Belief: but this
obtruding on <i>Scholars</i>, and <i>Physicians</i> too, is
no less exposing Physick than Physicians. Such
Credulity is the very Reverse of the Incredulity
our <i>Saviour</i> complains of, and no less Marvellous.
It is indeed Marvellous, how People
were Unbelievers after the greatest Evidence
of Reason and Miracle: Yet we cannot forbear
admiring, if People should swallow all this
Trifle and Contradiction, against all Sense
and Reason. We are, indeed, at a loss to explain
this lazy Credulity; and therefore we
must have Recourse to the general <i>Infection</i>,
that has wrought so strong Delusion, of late
Years, all over <i>Europe</i>; when we find Men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>have become wonderfully Credulous, even to
<i>Infatuation</i>. Upon this Supposition a very tolerable
good Account may be given of the mentioned
Attempts, for fathoming the Credulity
of Men, let that be found to be ever so deep.
If we hove our Lead in the <i>South Sea</i>, we could
sound to an hundred Fathom, and bring up
yellow Sand upon the Lead. Some Doctors
have often sounded fifty Fathom for yellow
Sand; and Doctor <i>Anodyne Necklace</i> almost
as deep for the same. The <i>South Sea</i> Pilots
have now run us a-ground, notwithstanding
the Depth of Water; and Men begin to recover
their Senses by the <i>Surprize</i>, <i>Terriculamenta</i>
being often found useful to Children: And,
I hope, now they are awake, they will never
hereafter subject either their <i>Lives</i> or <i>Fortunes</i>
to <i>Directors</i> of any kind.</p>

<p class='c006'>But as we are, at present, got into the Metaphors
of Trade and Navigation, it has been
no small Omission, in every kind of Director,
that they have lately forgot the Genius of <i>England</i>;
of its being a Country of Merchants.
Had Dr. <i>Mead</i> remember’d the Place of his
Education, he might likewise have saved himself
much Labour in explaining a groundless
<i>Phænomenon</i>, and spoke more Truth. Was
not Dr. <i>Mead</i> bred, if not born, within the
Smoak of <i>Black Wall</i> and <i>Wapping</i>, where
both <i>Church</i> and <i>Conventicle</i> have long been a
safe Retreat to foreign Goods, that were not
to stand the awful View of a <i>Custom House</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Officer? Yet, in all that Time, and ever since,
there have not appeared any Degrees of a
Plague. Have not Merchandize been brought
from many Parts of <i>Turkey</i>, all which have
very deservedly an ill Name for the <i>Pestilence</i>,
that very commonly rages among them. And
how comes it to pass, That during this constant,
and uninterrupted Commerce, when
<i>soft</i> and <i>porous</i> Goods, the proper <i>Fomes</i>, have
been brought from <i>Smyrna</i>, <i>Scanderoon</i>, <i>Aleppo</i>,
<i>Constantinople</i>, and other Parts, the Pestilence
has never taken a Journey hither, in all
Appearance, those Fifty five Years? In all
that Time <i>Turkey</i> Goods have not served a
Quarantine, nor visited any other <i>Lazaretto</i>’s,
besides the Companies Cellars; a certain Proof
that Goods very seldom, or ever, bring a Plague
into a Country; and oftner find it there than
propagate it.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is very remarkable, That our Commerce
with <i>Swedeland</i>, <i>Poland</i>, and other Parts of
those Eastern Countries, has been very considerable,
when Plagues have been raging
among the mentioned People; and yet we have
not found any Attempts from this silent Enemy
on this our happy Island. Nay, we must more
especially observe, that in the Year 1708 and
1709, a most destructive Pestilence made great
Waste in <i>Dantzig</i>; and, that there were some
Hundreds of <i>British</i> Ships bound up in Ice, the
whole Winter through; yet we had no other
Visit from it, than the supposed fag End of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>by the <i>Dunkirk</i> Fever; which happen’d four
Years after the former had expir’d. And therefore
this Opinion, of a Pestilence being preserved,
and convey’d to distant Places in Goods, as
a <i>Fomes</i>, is not sufficiently supported; a particular
Care ought to be taken to suppress such ill-grounded
Notions, so prejudicial and hurtful to
the People, and Trade of an Island Country.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Account Dr. <i>Hodges</i> gives us of the
Behaviour of the People of <i>London</i>, after they
returned to Town in Winter 1665, is an undeniable
Experiment against a Pestilence being
propagated from a <i>Fomes</i>, and almost from
one Body to another. He tells us<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c007'><sup>[6]</sup></a>, <i>The
Houses which before were full of the Dead, were
now again inhabited by the Living; and the
Shops, which had been most part of the Year
shut up, were again opened, and the People
again chearfully went about their wonted Affairs
of Trade and Employ; and even </i>what is
almost beyond belief<i>, those Citizens, who were
before afraid, even of their Friends and Relations,
would, without fear, venture into the Houses
and Rooms where infected Persons had a little
before breathed their Last: Nay, such Comforts did
inspire the languishing People, and such Confidence,
that many went into the </i><span class='sc'>Beds</span><i>, where
Persons had died, </i><span class='sc'>even before they were
Cold</span><i>, or cleansed from the </i><span class='sc'>Stench</span><i> of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span></i><span class='sc'>Disease</span><i>.</i> I would gladly know of Dr. <i>Mead</i>,
if this, and the mentioned Histories, are Experiments
that come home to the Purpose.
In this Account of Dr. <i>Hodges</i>, there is no
want of a <i>Nest</i> or <i>Fomes</i>, for here is <i>Wool</i>,
<i>Linnen</i>, <i>Silk</i>, and, perhaps, even treacherous
<i>Cotton</i> it self, the most secure Plague-Keeper
of all the rest; yet no further Contagion appeared,
but Men eagerly pursued their Business,
and thought only how to <i>repair the past
Mortality</i>, and that with more than ordinary
Success, as Dr. <i>Hodges</i> tells us in this Place,
and his Relation is fully confirm’d by the Bills
of Mortality.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is now very manifest, that Dr. <i>Mead</i> has
not given any tolerable, or probable Account
of his <i>propagating</i> Causes; and that every
Thing he has offer’d, in his own Way, is a
<i>Corruption</i> of what has been said by many
Physicians. Moreover, he does not yet seem
to understand Matters of Propagation, for he
makes his Causes propagate by themselves,
contrary to the common and known Methods
of Nature. In this he is not only unnatural,
but I am afraid, that this his Method must
be very <i>defective</i>, tho’ it carries his peculiar
mark of Excellency, <i>in differing from the Methods
taken in former Times among us, and from
what they commonly do Abroad</i>. For formerly
here in <i>England</i>, and the People abroad,
thought it necessary that the <i>Seeds</i> of the
Plague should, like other Seeds, have a proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><i>Matrice</i> to receive them, to cherish them,
and to rear them up for their proper and peculiar
Uses, consonant to their Nature. They
could not see how a Plague could more thrive
out of its proper Ground, than a Grain of
<i>Wheat</i>, or the Seed of an <i>Apple</i>. So that it
was incumbent on Dr. <i>Mead</i>, to have shewn
the <i>Disposition</i> that may be in every Man to
receive, and entertain the Plague, and with
all the Variety in which it palpably affects
them. For a Plague has often laid its devouring
Hands on <i>Children</i> and <i>Young Men</i>,
when it has spared the <i>Old</i>; and, on the contrary,
it has proved fatal to <i>Age</i>, when Youth
has been excused: Nor has a Pestilence that
afflicted Men hurt <i>Women</i>. At other Times
Men and Women of all Ages have felt its
Strokes promiscuously, and some have conversed
boldly among the Sick of the Plague with
Safety, while others are quickly punished for
their Rashness.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was very remarkable, that there was not
a <i>British</i> Subject, that wintered in <i>Dantzig</i>
in that hard Frost, and Time of Pestilence,
received any Hurt, while Thousands of the
Natives fell on their Right Hand, and Ten
Thousands on their Left: This happen’d in
the Year 1713. But it is recorded by <a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c007'><sup>[7]</sup></a><i>Utenhovius</i>,
that in a cruel Plague that raged in
<i>Copenhagen</i>, all Strangers, <i>English</i>, <i>Dutch</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><i>Germans</i>, were not affected with it, when at
the same Time it made Havock among the
Inhabitants; yet those Foreigners went freely
every where among the infected People, and
into the infected Houses.</p>

<p class='c006'>What could Dr. <i>Mead</i> mean by so gross an
Oversight, in an Article, too, so material for
<i>preventing</i> pestilential Contagion? This Disposition,
to be affected peculiarly by the
Plague, is not neglected by <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Galen</i>,
or any good Author of succeeding Ages;
tho’ they had the same Reason to profess their
Ignorance, as Dr. <i>Mead</i> has to conceal his at
this Time; for he is sure to make no Confession
of this kind, howsoever it may otherwise
appear. I hope he will not call this <i>a great
Digression</i>, as we find he did formerly, on a
like Occasion. <i>Fernelius</i> declares, that it is
very hard and difficult to know, what it is
that renders every Body obnoxious to the
Plague. And <i>Platerus</i> makes this ingenuous
Confession, That as I would gladly learn what
this <i>Disposition</i> of an Object may be; so I very
readily confess, that I know nothing of it,
though I am not ignorant, that this Poison
acts very differently, according to the various
Dispositions of the Body. And, what Hurt had
it done Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Character to have owned,
That no <i>Agent</i> can do any Thing without a
fit <i>Disposition</i> in the <i>Patient</i>? But, how dares
he undertake to give Rules for preventing a
Pestilence, and proceed in corrupting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Means of Knowledge that are common among
other Physicians, and absolutely neglect this
Disposition? It is for this Reason, that we hear
them speaking another Language than Doctor
<i>Mead</i> does, even while they talk of what he
calls his propagating Causes. Hear the excellent,
and learned <i>Fracastorius</i><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c007'><sup>[8]</sup></a>. <i>Contagion</i>,
says he, takes its Rise, often from the Air; it
often passes from one Person to another; it is
often receiv’d by a <i>Fomes</i>; and it sometimes
has its first Origine and Beginning in <i>our selves</i>.
Hence it is we find Dr. <i>Hodges</i>, in the common
Language of Physicians, asserting, that
<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c007'><sup>[9]</sup></a><i>four Things are necessary to a Contagion</i>. First,
<i>That there is an Efflux of the contagious</i> Seminium,
<i>or</i> Seed. Secondly, <i>That there is a
convenient Medium for the contagious Particles
to move through, and be conveyed by</i>. Thirdly,
<i>A </i>Fitness<i> in the </i>Subject<i> to receive and cherish
the contagious Effluvia</i>. <i>And</i>, Fourthly, <i>A
due Stay of this Seminium</i>. So that it is much
to be feared, that Dr. <i>Mead</i> will suffer grievously
in explaining his darling <i>Phenomena</i>, to
which we are next to return; and no less in
teaching us, <i>in the following Part of his Discourse</i>,
how to prevent the silent Approaches
of the Pestilence, and to suppress its Poison, if
it should appear among us: All which he graciously
promises to perform, and that in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>newer and perfecter Method than was ever
done before.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have followed Dr. <i>Mead</i> with great Patience,
into his <i>real</i> and <i>propagating</i> Causes of
the Plague; because they are the <i>Principles</i>
and <i>Ground-work</i> upon which he is to build
the Explication of his Appearances, and the
Method of <i>preventing</i> and <i>curing</i> the Plague;
and if that should prove defective, the whole
Work will fall into Ruins of it self, without
doing it the least Violence: And thereby I
shall neither tire my Reader, nor trouble my
self, and only touch upon those Things very
slightly, where he has either departed from the
Truth, or contradicted himself. For, after
the Foundation of any Position is over-turned,
there is nothing more to be done, but merely
to repeat what is already proved, and that as
often as the Position is offered and assigned.
And therefore it must not be expected that any
one will spend, and waste his Time, in the
pursuit of every Trifle, with the like exactness
and fullness: That may be, perhaps, the
Business of an Orator, but never of a Philosopher.
I have been purposely thus prolix, that
I may be shorter in putting an End to the remainder;
nor have I leisure to animadvert on
all the Blunders of this Author.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have already shewn the Impotency of Dr.
<i>Mead</i> in managing an Argument; and, at the
same Time, I have over-turned and exploded
some common Opinions, that were by him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>weakly defended; and that, because it is of
great Use and Importance that Mankind be
rightly apprized of them. How easily are
any Man’s Fears dispell’d? What real Security
does he acquire, when his <i>Reason</i> is convinced,
that the <i>Plague</i> of <i>Pestilence</i> is not begot
by any <i>Contagion</i>, properly speaking? That
this Plague is not propagated from the Body of
a <i>Sick</i> Person into the Body of the <i>Sound</i>: That
it makes no <i>Nest</i>, is not <i>cherished</i>, nor <i>nursed</i>
in <i>soft</i> or <i>porous</i> Bodies, that its Seeds may be
<i>propagated</i> and <i>conveyed</i> into far <i>distant</i> Countries.
And therefore, as we are to follow Dr.
<i>Mead</i> in the remaining Part of his <i>Short Discourse</i>,
we must go back to consider some <i>Phenomena</i>,
he thought fit to premise to his Inquiries
about <i>Contagion</i>, but what, I hope
every Reader will think, are most properly
considered in this Place, if he will pardon the
considering them at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first Thing we are presented with, is
a heavy Charge against the Winds, for not
doing their Duty; but that <i>Æolus</i> himself is
an <i>Aider</i> and <i>Abettor</i> of Plagues, by not
sending his Winds Abroad, and thereby stagnating
the Air; for we are taught in this curious
Discourse, <a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c007'><sup>[10]</sup></a><i>That the Use of Winds is to
purify the Air by their Motion</i>. But this
Charge is altogether false, and ill grounded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>because, Wind in <i>England</i> is put to many
Uses; it not only blows cold, but it blows
hot; it fans our Ladies, and our Corn too;
it dries Linnen, and sails our Ships, <i>&amp;c.</i> Besides,
this Charge is absolutely false, for the
Physician that has left an Account of the
Winds Behaviour in 1665<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c007'><sup>[11]</sup></a>, tells us, That it
was very dutiful, and, that the whole Summer
was refreshed with moderate Breezes,
sufficient to prevent the Air’s <i>Stagnation</i> and
<i>Corruption</i>, and to carry off the <i>pestilential
Steams</i>: The Heat was likewise too mild to
encourage such <i>Corruption</i> and <i>Fermentation</i>
as helps to taint the animal Fluids. And
therefore howsoever fond Dr. <i>Mead</i> is of Stagnation,
through any failure of the Winds, it is
certain that they were then very blameless,
let the Doctor find his Stagnation where he can.
Moreover, the Physicians were not of Opinion,
at that Time<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c007'><sup>[12]</sup></a>, that the <i>Air</i> was <i>infected</i>,
and therefore Doctor <i>Hodges</i> tells us, That
they were against making Fires, for the Reason
of this Purity of Air; and, that Fires are
only proper when it is <i>impure</i> and <i>corrupted</i>.
After this Account of Things, who will question
Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s great <i>Acuteness</i> and <i>Accuracy</i>
in making Observations; or, whether am
not I more to be blamed for observing those
Trifles of the Doctor? Yet I cannot avoid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>making one short Observation more, which
may proceed from the small Regard the Doctor
has to Memory; for at two Pages off he
assures us, <i>That our Air is not disposed to receive
such</i> (contagious) <i>Impressions</i>; then what
need we mind the Stagnation of the Air? Is
there a Man in <i>England</i>, that will not forgive
him this Contradiction, if he will make the
last part of it good?</p>

<p class='c006'>But we are immediately to have more Comfort
of this Kind; for he assures us, That
<i>Plagues seem to be of the Growth of the
</i>Southern<i> and </i>Eastern<i> Parts of the World</i>; and
I am sorry that they only seem to be so; because
what follows may <i>seem</i> only to be true,
<i>That there is not in this Island particularly, any
one Instance of a pestilential Disease among us,
of great Consequence, that we have not received
from other infected Places</i>. Here is another
Draw-back upon us again: A <i>pestilential Disease</i>
of any Consequence! Is any Plague in
a Country without Consequence? Surely
many Widows and Orphans find it otherwise.
But the Doctor will make amends for Families
brought to Ruin and Poverty, by the loss of
Parents and Husbands; by ridding us of a
vulgar Error, of the Plague visiting us once in
Thirty or Forty Years. So that if a Plague
brings a mighty Calamity along with it, we
may comfort our selves, that it comes but
seldom.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>This was the very Purpose for which he
gave us, with great Assurance, the Origine of
Plagues; because he would charitably rescue
us from an <i>Opinion propagated by Authors of
great Name, that we are visited with the
Plague once in thirty or forty Years; which is
a mere Fancy, without any Foundation either in
Reason or Experience</i>. I cannot assign any
Reason for the Plague thus visiting us; but
Experience is not of the side of the terrible,
but common Opinion, as <i>Hodges</i><a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c007'><sup>[13]</sup></a> assures us,
and the Bills of Mortality confirm; for there
we find it has visited us oftner, with all its
<i>Tokens</i>, <i>Buboes</i>, and <i>Carbuncles</i>, and more
than once since that Time, if Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s <i>pestilential
Diseases</i>, of smaller Consequence,
are admitted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if the Plague of Pestilence has thus
frequently shewn it self, in its most terrible
manner, and very often not so terribly, how
can People prevent taking <i>Fright</i> at the <i>King</i>
of <i>Terrors</i>? Or, with what Face can Dr. <i>Mead</i>
call terrible Death, <i>vain Fears</i>? Can a reasonable
People, relying on History, and their
own Experience of Things, be delivered from
their Fears, by a bold Assertion, that can proceed
from no other Cause, than great Ignorance,
or the worst Opinion of the Reason and
Experience of Mankind, that they are subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to so gross an Imposition, as to take <i>Comfort</i> in
the most <i>lamentable</i> Danger, <i>exposed</i> to Death,
and <i>forsaken</i> by their dearest Friends; and all
upon an Assertion, that is neither grounded on
<i>Knowledge</i>, nor <i>Integrity</i>? It may be a <i>pia
Fraus, a well meant Cheat</i>, but it cannot be
of any manner of Use.</p>

<p class='c006'>The truest Comfort arises from an Opinion,
That an Adviser knows what he says; and
says, what in his Conscience he believes to be
true. How much greater is the Comfort we
take, from a Perswasion that the Plague seldom,
or never, passes from one Body into
another, as was lately proved? As also, that
Observations rather inform us of the Seeds of a
Pestilence, seldom, or never, being brought
over to us in foreign Goods; and besides these
two Perswasions, founded on Reason and Experience,
we have the Authority of the best
Physicians in all Ages, that the Plague, nor
any other Disease, is speedily generated. By
the first of those Accounts, we have fewer
Chances for being sick; and we are sure, by
the second, that we have Time to prevent it,
or to take the Distemper early, before it is settled
into a Habit, or confirmed in a Disease.
Such Reasoning, such Observation, is proceeding
on good and firm Ground; the other, altogether
depends on the Knowledge and Honesty
of the Insurer, which can never be depended
on, if we have any doubt about his Sincerity,
or Understanding.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>What Doctor <i>Mead</i> has already said, is contrary
to the Experience of Mankind, and is
purely supported on his bare Assertion; and
therefore, I am afraid no great Comfort can
be reasonably taken from it.</p>

<p class='c006'>His next Assertion, about the Sweating Sickness,
labours under all the Defects imaginable.
He will not allow it to be of <i>British</i> Original;
nay, that <i>it is a Plague abated in its Violence by
the mild Temperament of our Climate</i>. He, afterwards,
brings it from <i>France</i>, and clears the
<i>French</i> of its being bred among them; for
they, says he, brought it from the Siege of
<i>Rhodes</i>. Can any Man equal this Doctor in
Assertion? Or in quoting History absurdly?
For it carries the Name of <i>Sudor Anglicus</i>,
and our Country charged for having produced
it. All foreign Physicians declare it peculiar
to <i>England</i>; and, that a parcel of it went into
<i>Holland</i>; but neither <i>French</i>, nor <i>Italian</i>
Physician, heard any Thing of it, in their
own Country, nor among the <i>Greek</i> Islands;
and the <i>Dutch</i> fix the Scene of the Sweating
Sickness in <i>England</i>. So the Sweating Sickness
was four Times in <i>England</i>, and no
where else; yet it is the Fag-end of the Plague
brought from <i>Rhodes</i>, and thither God knows
how, or from whence: But all this supported
by much foreign Reading.</p>

<p class='c006'>He <i>calls this Distemper a Plague with lessen’d
Force, </i>because<i> the Symptoms of it were
of that Kind, tho’ in a less Degree, as great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Faintness and Inquietudes, inward Burning,
Pains in the Head, a Delirium</i>, &amp;c. I am
glad we have Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s Description of a
Plague, it being the first Time he has ventur’d
to mention it; and, to do him Justice,
he has touched upon it very gently: But, if
this is the Plague, we are not seldom, but often
visited with it. So there ends our Comfort.</p>

<p class='c006'>Is this truly a Plague, <i>feeble and week</i> thro’
travelling? And did infinite Persons die suddenly
of it? And that in Twenty four Hours.
Pray, what can we think happen’d to the
Nations that felt the sharp end of it, and
those that came under its Fury, long before it
reach’d us? Surely more than infinite Persons
of them must have perished, and in infinitely
shorter Time than Twenty four Hours, so
that great Tracts of Country must have been
dispeopled in one Day. Can any Man think
an <i>Æra</i> as remarkable as the <i>Deluge</i>, could
pass in History without Observation? Or, that
all Historians should overlook so great a Wonder,
the very Soul of an Historian, and all to
fix a Calumny on our <i>English</i> Air, and to call
a <i>monstrous</i> Disease a <i>British</i> Fever? It must
be owned, that the Doctor is the greatest
Traveller that ever was; for he has entertained
us with the most <i>admirable</i> and <i>surprizing</i>
Relation of the <i>Feats</i> and <i>Travels</i> of a
Plague that ever was told.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sufficiently shews the great <i>Candor</i> of
our Author, and his great <i>Judgment</i> in comparing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Diseases, as has been already noted by
another Hand; for if a Plague kills infinite
Persons in Twenty four Hours, I cannot see
how properly it can be called <i>Feeble</i>; nay,
if a true Judgment is made of it, the Plague
in <i>France</i> is not to be compared to it for its
Strength; and, God knows, the <i>French</i> find
its Power too great, and God grant that we
may never try its Feebleness. Our Author’s
<i>Judgment</i> is no less conspicuous, in comparing
what he calls the <i>Dunkirk Fever</i>, with the
<i>Sweating Sickness</i>, for that was neither an
<i>Ephemera</i> of one, nor of more Days; neither
did it terminate in Twenty four Hours. How
then are those two Diseases alike, that have
nothing of the same <i>Features</i> or Resemblance,
no more than the Time of their Duration was
the same. Besides, this was not the Fag-end
of any Plague, but a Fever we find to be very
common in all the Marshy Places in the Low
Countries; and what the <i>Dutch</i> call a Fever
from the <span class='sc'>Polders</span>, and that happens in the
end of a hot Summer, or in the beginning of
the Autumn.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if I may guess by the <i>Cant</i> Name we find
this Fever bears, of the <i>Dunkirk Fever</i>, I may
believe the Doctor means that <i>Schelick</i> Fever
that happened in 1715; but I will not answer
for the Time: This Fever was then called the
<i>Galloping</i> Fever, because too many Physicians
knew not a more proper Name for it, and it
was a new Disease to them. This Fever indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>lasted 3 or 4 Days, and often went off
with a gentle Sweat, but killed no body,
whatever Method they took for curing it, or
that they did not any thing for its Cure. Now,
with Submission to the great Dr. <i>Mead</i>, I
cannot find the Relation and Likeness this
<i>Galloping Fever</i> has to the <i>Sweating Sickness</i>,
Native of <i>England</i>, in the very beginning, and
the end of the Reign of <i>Henry</i> VII.</p>

<p class='c006'>One Observation I would make from the
foregoing Accounts, and that is very comfortable
to <i>Patients</i> and their <i>Physicians</i>; that,
<i>hereafter</i>, neither of these will think themselves
ill used, for Dr. <i>Mead</i>’s saying, that a
Physician (especially if he hates or fears him
more than the Plague) has mistaken his Disease,
and has prescrib’d improperly on that,
or any other Account: and that because we
find him little acquainted with the Descriptions
of Diseases, and not over-faithful in relating
them. Let this <i>Corollary</i>, <i>Scholium</i>, or which
of this Language he affects, never <i>depart</i> from
the Memory of a judicious; reasonable Patient,
or his or her Physician.</p>

<p class='c006'>I ought not to remark further in this first
Part, if he did not expect I should not omit
what he says of the <i>Fury</i> of the Plague in
1665. This Scene is prepared by calling in a
Disposition to Contagion that is in every, the
very best of, Air; and hereby we felt this Calamity
of a Plague in this Year. He says, <i>It
continued in this City about ten Months; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>swept away by Computation 97306 Persons</i>. He
will have it allowed, that the Disease came by
<i>Cotton</i>; and he charges the Duration of it on
the Government, by their ordering to shut up
the Houses. But this is the Unhappiness of
this Physician, that he makes every Relation
either incredible, or frivolous, when he would
point out its Greatness, and make us feel it. I
cannot tell where he pick’d up this Account;
but he makes it less terrible than it was truly,
by misrepresenting the Fact. Dr. <i>Hodges</i> tells
us, that some computed the Loss by the Plague
to have been One Hundred Thousand; and
herein he is followed by Doctor <i>Rosary</i>, alias
<i>Anodyne-Necklace</i>: but no body can tell Dr.
<i>M</i>’s Voucher.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if we consult the Bill of Mortality of
that Year, we find only fifty Thousand one
Hundred and 22; and if we add 1/4 Mr.
<i>Graunt</i> proves to be suppressed in the Account,
there will be sixty six Thousand six Hundred
and 96 died of the Plague in 1665.
But if we consider that it began about the
<i>27th</i> of <i>December, 1664</i>. and ended the <i>26th</i>
of <i>September, 1665</i>. we find it did not last above
nine Months. Consider likewise, that
from the <i>27th</i> of <i>December</i> to the <i>6th</i> of <i>June</i>
inclusively there only died 92. and therefore the
Mortality is to be reckoned from the <i>13th</i> of
<i>June, 1665</i>. to the <i>26th</i> of <i>September</i> in that
Year. Now if we take the Mortality to have
been equal (as it was not) from the <i>13th</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span><i>June</i> to the <i>26th</i> of <i>September</i>, the Mortality
did not last above 16 Weeks: So that the
Mortality was really greater than if there had
died equally 100000 in ten Months; for in
this Case there only died 2500 each Week:
but by the true Account there died 4162. a
far greater Mortality, and far more terrible,
than what is brought on the former Supposition,
about the time the Plague lasted, and
the Havock that it made in that time.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not only the Numbers that fall by the
Plague that strike Terror into Men, but the
Suddenness and Manner of Dying heighten
our Fears, and make every thing more terrible;
for Physicians have been Strangers to the
Disease, nor have their Remedies been able to
give any Check to its Fury. The People die
with Medicines and without them, and those
that have seemed to be useful in one Case,
have seldom failed to prove hurtful in another.
No body is found strong enough to resist
it, neither they who had the best Constitution,
nor they who have been treated in the
best Method. But what is most grievous, on
those Occasions, is the great Despair that seizes
the Infected, who are so far from submitting
to the most proper Endeavours that may be
made for their Cure, that they abandon, and
give themselves up as helpless, and out of the
Power of any Relief: while the Disease gets
Ground, acquires new Strength, and lays desolate

It is with the greatest Pleasure we enter
upon the Method of <i>preventing</i>,
tho’ not of <i>curing</i> this <i>insidious</i> Enemy
of Mankind, which very justly has filled the
World with Fear and Horror. For this Reason,
and that Matters may proceed not only
in greater Order, but also with greater Truth,
Dr. <i>Mead</i> has gone through much <i>Philosophy</i>
and <i>Theory</i> in <i>Medicine</i>, with great <i>Labour</i>
and <i>Fatigue</i>; even to <i>fainting</i> away, <i>despairing</i>
often in doing any thing to his own Satisfaction,
knowing by much Experience, that
the World is not so hard to please.</p>

<p class='c006'>And therefore, he begins this second Part,
by telling us, how great a <i>Satisfaction</i> it is, <i>to
know that the Plague is no Native of our Country</i>.
I hope he is satisfy’d with this Conceit,
but I am afraid few People find any new Assurance,
and Courage, springing up in them,
upon this Assertion; or that they can have a
better Heart to face the Plague more boldly,
if it should be our Misfortune to have a Visit
from it at this time.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>But in what Page does this Demonstration
lie? He has only told us, hitherto, that the
<i>pure</i> Air is only <i>infected</i> with <i>pestilential
Steams</i>, that rise out of Bogs; or out of Men
that have died of the Plague; or else that these
Steams were packed up in Goods, and with
them carried from one Country into another:
and tho’ this be bravely told, without any
Reason assigned for it; yet we know not
where they first have their Origine, and of
what Country they are Natives. We have
seen an Original English Plague, that came
from no Place in the World, and took up its
Abode altogether here; and whether all the
rest, that have afflicted our Island, are Natives
or Foreigners, is nothing so clear, as to
build any great Satisfaction upon. And therefore,
I do think, with the Doctor, that all
Means should be found out to <i>keep our selves
clear from it</i>; tho’ we can find no great <i>Encouragement</i>
from what he yet has told us.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Caution, as he tells us, consists of two
Parts: <i>The preventing its being brought into
our Island</i>; and, <i>The putting a stop to its spreading
among us</i>. But, as the Doctor has a very
ill Memory, and seldom performs what he
promises, give me leave to put him in mind
of a Promise, in his Preface; that <i>his Method
will be different from that taken in former
times among us, and from what they commonly
do abroad</i>: Tho’ we have no Encouragement
to think, that <i>it will prove agreeable to Reason</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The Doctor is very full on this first Head
of Caution, and bestows no fewer than
nine Pages about <i>Quarantines</i>, and <i>Lazarettoes</i>;
but as there is nothing newer said of
them than what has been known, these two
hundred Years; I leave that Affair to the Civil
Magistrate, whose Care can never exceed,
when it’s employed for the Good of the People.
But as far as we may depend upon the
first, and Philosophical Part of this Discourse,
there is no great Occasion for either of them:
We live a great way from the South of <i>France</i>,
and the Doctor has assured us, that the Plague
cannot reach us, by some hundreds of Miles.
For, to our Satisfaction be it remember’d,
that Air it self is very pure and harmless; nor
can it otherwise be infected, than by pestilential
Steams issuing out of Bodies, at the end of
the Disease; as also, that they cannot travel
any length, if there is not a Disposition in
the Air, which it only has when supposed.
And therefore, we are very little obnoxious
to a Plague, and consequently have no great
Occasion for <i>Lazarettoes</i> or <i>Quarantines</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot omit, without incurring Displeasure,
the pretty Expedient the Doctor recommends,
for discovering when the Plague has
forsaken a Parcel of Goods; and that because
he might foresee a Question might arise, about
the Time they should serve their <i>Quarantine</i>;
and whether forty Days were sufficient. His
Answer is fine! why; <i>we must set little Birds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>upon the exposed Goods</i>. But, may not the
Attempt prove dangerous, and as dangerous
as to set a lighted Match to a good large Barrel
of Gun-powder. The Reason for this Experiment,
is, because it has been observed in
times of the Plague, that that Country is forsaken
by the Birds; and for this he quotes
<i>Diemerbroeck</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>How beautifully are such Presages related
by <i>Lucretius</i>, <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, and other Poets;
but how insipidly are they misapplied on this
Occasion. Physicians have carefully observed
and recorded, every thing considerable and
extraordinary that preceded the Pestilence;
and that in order to provide themselves against
it, and to give the Alarm of its first Approaches,
that People may provide for their
Safety in time. Some of these Presages are
taken from the <i>Heavens</i>; some from the <i>Air</i>;
others from the <i>Earth</i>; and many from the
<i>Waters</i>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>——<i>Sæpe exiguus Mus</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Augurium tibi triste dabit.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>But as the Consideration of those Presages
do not fall properly in my way at this time;
we proceed next to consider, how a stop is put
to the Plague, in <i>Case, through a Miscarriage
in the Publick Care, by the Neglect of Officers,
or otherwise, such a Calamity should be suffered
to befal us</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>And here we must observe, that this Art
of <i>Quarantines</i>, and <i>Lazarettoes</i>, is so infallible,
that we may blame the Civil Magistrate,
and his Officers, if ever the Plague is suffered
to come among us. For my part, I cannot
think any Government so foolishly malicious
to suffer a Plague to come into their Country,
if they knew how to avoid it. But that
we may not slightly bring an ill Report
against Governors; the Physicians are to be
blamed, when the Orders of the Civil Magistrate
are hurtful; for he always takes Counsel
with Physicians in all Matters, relating
to <i>Nature</i> and <i>Health</i>: This has been the
Practice in all Nations, and in all Times,
since Mankind has been govern’d by Law;
and if these wrong Measures are owing <i>to the
Ignorance of the true Nature of Contagion</i>,
surely it’s none of the Magistrate’s Business to
discover it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Magistrate may contradict his former
Orders, for any Thing that is better, at least
not so pernicious, as those whereunto he was
led by Physicians. But the Physicians in <i>London</i>
might not have advised the shutting up of
Houses, if they had remember’d the fatal Experiments
of it in other Countries, recorded in
Books of Physick. <i>Mercurialis</i> tells us, how
the Houses were shut up in <i>Milan</i> on this Occasion,
but that the Magistrates found their
Mistake in a Week, and set them open again,
very much to the Comfort of the Healthy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Relief of the Sick. The same learned Author
informs us, that burning <i>infected Goods</i> was
found to do great Mischief in a Plague in <i>Padua</i>,
and what then shall we think of our
celebrated Physician, who <a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c007'><sup>[15]</sup></a>recommends this
Method of Burning? <a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c007'><sup>[16]</sup></a><i>Quapropter</i>, says the
famous <i>Mercurialis</i>, <i>non possum commendare eos,
qui hisce temporibus infectas supellectiles in urbibus
cremant, propterea quod</i>, &amp;c. We may
surely say, that this Error is not only <i>owing to
his Ignorance of the true Nature of Contagion</i>,
but even of his Ignorance of what Physicians
do Abroad.</p>

<p class='c006'>I think the Doctor has made a little
too free with the Civil Magistrate, and his
Brethren of the Faculty; especially, that
he has no where told us any Thing of the Nature
of Contagion; not so much as what we
may read in many Books of Physick. And
therefore his further inveighing against <i>Physick</i>
and <i>Physicians</i>, is the most surprizing, unaccountable
Indiscretion that Man ever was
guilty of: A Man that has done nothing, but
to corrupt it: For thus he puts an End to a
great deal of rambling Stuff, about shutting
up Houses. <a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c007'><sup>[17]</sup></a><i>The Management in former Times
neither answers the Purpose of discovering the
beginning of the Infection, nor of putting a stop
to it when discovered; other Measures are certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to be taken, which I think should be of
this Nature.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Here begins an Account of Things to be
done in a <i>new</i> Manner, and what will be
found <i>agreeable</i> to Reason. <i>Imprimis</i>, Then,
<i>instead of ignorant old Women, we ought to have
understanding and diligent Men</i>. There is nothing
New in this, nor very <i>Unreasonable</i>;
but as the Doctor has enhansed the whole
Knowledge of Physick in his own Person,
and made <i>old Women</i> of his <i>Brethren</i>, I hope
he will allow these <i>Officers</i> of <i>Health</i> to consist
of discarded Physicians. <i>Secondly, When
the sick Families are gone</i> (whether?) <i>all the
Goods of the Houses, in which they were, should
be burnt; nay, the Houses themselves, if that
can conveniently be done.</i> A very good Advice,
and, I hope, the City of <i>London</i> will
erect another <i>Monument</i> for the Doctor, after
they have burned their City, upon so <i>reasonable</i>
Advice. But as this Advice has been
found hurtful in Experience, so neither is it
<i>New</i>, because it has been practised Two Hundred
Years ago; as I lately observed. He
has now the late Fire of <i>London</i> in view, and
recommends another general Conflagration of
our City, from the great Good, he fancies,
accrued thereby: But the Reason he brings
is admirable. <i>For nothing approaches so near
to the first Original of Contagion, as Air pent
up, loaded with Damps.</i> This is the very
Reason, why <i>Hippocrates</i>, and all other Physicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>after him, have advised making Fires
for preventing the Plague; neither spared they
any <i>Expence</i> in <i>Scents</i>, <i>sweet</i> and <i>aromatick
Woods</i>; and even they put <i>sacred</i> Things to
that very Use. Yet, according to Custom,
the Doctor <a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c007'><sup>[18]</sup></a>contradicts himself, on this Article,
at the small distance of four Pages;
where Fires again are condemned as pernicious.
The Reason alledged for this later Experiment
is absolutely false; for Dr. <i>Hodges</i>
assures us, that the Weather was not Hot in
that Summer. But, I believe, the true Reason
of the Contradiction is, that the Doctor
will, at any Time, venture being found in a
Contradiction, three Doors off, as well as
four Pages off, to save his Bacon, or for a
merry Conceit. But there is, <i>even in this</i>,
nothing New, for there was one <i>Raymundus</i>,
who is noted for this Singularity by other Authors,
whose Words our Doctor seems to translate.
<i>Pestilentes Febres</i>, says <i>Raymundus</i>,
<i>Ardentes sunt, &amp; idcirco ab aere fervido, &amp;
calente augentur</i>. I must beg leave to crowd
in another Conclusion, because I follow the
Doctor; that as Fires are thus hurtful, so, and
for that Reason, is the <i>firing</i> of Guns. The
Word <i>Fire</i> is common in both Expressions,
but it was never the <i>Heat</i> of great Guns, but
their <i>Noise</i> that was recommended, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>is a sort of <i>Wind</i>, so much recommended formerly,
by Dr. <i>Mead</i>; <i>but what some have too
rashly advised. Mira vis verbis.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>But to return to <i>Damps</i>; he allows they
approach the first Original of Contagion, so
that if they are not the first, they may very
well be the second Original of Contagion; for
where there is a first, there is always a second
in every Order and Number of Things. Now,
as <i>Fires</i> are manifestly useful in the Damps of
Coal Pits, and Goals, why not in the raw
Damps of Contagion? And if that is a true
Experiment, why does Dr. <i>Mead</i> forsake <i>Hippocrates</i>,
and the antient Sages of Physick, for
an Error that is not new; and, perhaps, not
agreeable to Reason? And <i>Ovid</i> tells us, <i>Temporibus
Medicina valet</i>. As to the Story of the
<i>Black Assize</i> at <i>Oxford</i>, it shall not be carelessly
neglected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The last Member of Novelty mentioned, is
the keeping our <i>Houses and Streets clean from
Filth, Carrion, and all manner of Nusances</i>;
and I hope every Body will readily admit, that
this was never done before, neither <i>here</i> at
Home, nor <i>Abroad</i> in other Countries; and
I’ll swear for him, this Time, that it is highly
<i>necessary</i>. His Inference is strong; for if all
these <i>new</i> and <i>reasonable</i> Instructions <i>take
effect, there will be no need of any Methods,
for </i><span class='sc'>Correcting</span><i> the </i><span class='sc'>Air</span><i>, </i><span class='sc'>Purifying Houses</span><i>,
or of Rules for </i><span class='sc'>Preserving particular
Persons</span><i> from </i><span class='sc'>Infection</span><i>.</i> Yet in this very instant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>there follows a fresh Contradiction, if I
understand him; but least I do not, I shall give
you his own Words, in order to be better inform’d.
<i>To all which, if the Plague get head,
so that the Sick are too many to be removed, Regard
must be had.</i> Now, as far as I understand
the Doctor, the Plague may get Head
against all these infallible Methods, but I
cannot for my Life tell, what we are to
Regard; but as these Methods are both fallible
and infallible, at the same Time, the
Doctor has fallen into another gross <i>Contradiction</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, which is a more melancholy Story,
this seems to be the whole of <i>Preventing</i> we
have hitherto expected; so that all the Philosophy
he brought forth, in the first Part of his
Discourse, has only been to make us <i>Constables</i>
and <i>Scavengers</i>, to set the Watch, and clean
the Streets. A fine Account, indeed, of <i>Preventing</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Discourse never look’d as if it were to
live long, its first <i>Stamina</i> were so rotten, and
defective; and any one, with half an Eye,
might see it would die of an Apoplexy, or first
die and then have an Apoplexy, as the Fashion
of Dying has been of late.</p>

<p class='c006'>When I formerly observed the great Neglect
of the <i>Disposition</i> and <i>Aptness</i> of a Subject
to receive and cherish the Disease, I was then
very much afraid that the celebrated Dr. <i>Mead</i>
must suffer, when it was his Business to teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>us how to preserve our selves from Infection;
which has, at this Time, befallen him with a
witness; for now our Security consists in the
former. But if the Plague should chance to
force his Lines, it is very plain, that we must
surrender at Discretion to this most cruel Enemy.
Our Generals taught the <i>French</i>, some
Years ago, how slender a Defence Lines were;
and the Plague has taught them, to their sad
Experience, how insufficient they are to restrain
its Violence; for it has nor only marched
over their Lines in Defiance of their Guards,
but even <i>Eastwards</i> and <i>Southwards</i>, to the
Contempt of <i>Matthæus Villanus</i>, and our Doctor,
his zealous Follower.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I am, again, afraid that the Case at
present is much the same as it was in the beginning
of his <i>short Discourse</i>; for he then proposed
to treat of <i>Contagion</i>, but he quickly
dropp’d it, without so much as telling us what
is meant by the Word. Here now we should
<i>prevent</i>, but he knows as little of this as he
did formerly of Contagion: For when he <a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c007'><sup>[19]</sup></a><i>is
to consider by what Means particular Persons
may best defend themselves against Contagion</i>;
he adds, <i>for the effectual doing of which it would
be necessary to put the Humors of the Body into
such a State, as not to be alterable by the Matter
of Infection</i>. What Physician ever said so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>before Dr. <i>Mead</i>? And if an Impossibility of
this Nature was expected from the Faculty of
Physick, I hope they would acknowledge and
confess their Ignorance. It is the same
Thing, as if the Government should expect,
that Physicians are to cure the Subjects of any
one Disease, so that they should never feel it
hereafter; the <i>Curative</i> Part of <i>Physick</i>, in that
Sense, must be as impossible as the <i>Preservative</i>.
Mankind is more easy, and not only
bears with what is not possible, but even with
Blunders, that proceed from Ignorance and
Stupidity. All that is expected from Physicians,
is to have such Rules, whereby our
Health may be secured to them, as far as it is
consistent with Human Nature, and the
known Means: And if Dr. <i>Mead</i> would have
communicated some of those wise Rules, that
are to be found in Books of Physick, even
without deducing them from any Principle of
Reason, he then had done them the greatest
Good, and what they seem to want and
desire.</p>

<p class='c006'>That we may see, how little Doctor <i>Mead</i>
understands the Method of <i>Preventing</i>, and
also how practicable it is: We find <i>Hippocrates</i>
values himself for being the first that
foresaw a Disease; and he tells us, That
<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c007'><sup>[20]</sup></a><i>Diseases do not come upon Men of a sudden;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>but being collected by degrees, shew themselves
afterwards in the bulk</i>. And <a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c007'><sup>[21]</sup></a><i>Galen</i> says,
That <i>all Physicians are agreed, that there must
be some Time for breeding a Distemper</i>. Now,
if Diseases take a Time before they are bred;
then it is an obvious Consequence, that Diseases
may be prevented. Surely this is consonant
to common Sense; for an <i>Embryo</i> Disease
must be far more easily cured, than a Disease
after it is formed, and settled upon any Person;
and thereby his Strength, or Constitution, destroyed:
For however <i>Curative</i> Method, and
<i>Preservative</i>, are different Words, they only
signify the same Thing at different Times.
Curing a nascent Disease is <i>preserving</i> us from
being hurt by it; and curing a settled Disease,
where the Instruments of Action are hurt, is
curing it in the common Acceptation.</p>

<p class='c006'>And therefore our Doctor seems to have no
manner of Notion of these Words, when he
would tell us that it is as impossible to prevent
the Plague; as to have a <i>Specifick Preservative
from the Small Pox</i>; which we find
is far from being impossible. But why a <i>Specifick</i>?
Must he have a Specifick, because Dr.
<i>Anodyne Necklace</i> has one? I cannot find any
other Reason, especially, that it now plainly
appears, and is evident, that curing a Disease,
and preventing it, is the same Action, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>may be done with the same Tools, whether
they are Common, or Specifick, in the strictest
Sense Physicians use those Words. This
his Misunderstanding the Doctrine of Physicians
is further manifest from the last Paragraph
of his Discourse; that his Directions
may <i>be of Use towards establishing a better Method
of Cure</i>, than Authors have commonly
taught, which might be true, if that Doctrine
had been drawn from the Nature of <i>Infection</i>
or <i>Contagion</i>; but, at present, he knows as
little of the grammatical Sense of these Terms,
as he does of the Things themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us cease, then, to wonder why so great
Care is had to keep our <i>Houses</i> cool, at <i>Page
47</i>, and so little for our <i>Persons</i>, at <i>Page 49</i>
of the <i>Discourse</i>; and in Consequence to that,
we find more Receipts for a House than for a
Man. He mentions <i>Vinegar</i> upon the Authority
of <i>Rhazes</i>, which is no more for a Person
that affects an Opinion for being learned,
than if he had recommended it from Dr <i>Hodges</i>;
since Physicians know, how much it has been
esteemed by the most antient Physicians of
<i>Greece</i> and <i>Italy</i>: But this its Virtue in the
Plague of Pestilence is not contrary to what
Authors advise, in making Fumes of hot
Things on that Occasion. This is very manifest,
if the Doctor will consider what the great
<i>Celsus</i> has said of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it will not be difficult to give a very
probable Conjecture, why our Doctor gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>so trifling, and contradictory Account of those
Medicines, recommended for preserving us
against the Plague; even, when there is not
so great a Store for any other Disease, and
some of them come well recommended for the
Purpose of <i>Preventing</i>; if we remember the
common Method of our Author through all
this Book; for he constantly tells us, in the
end of one Paragraph, what he offers to our
Belief in the next. He has all along thrown
mighty Contempt upon Physicians, when he
would recommend himself; and now he disparages
their Medicines; and surely, upon no
other Design, but to set up his own. But what
in the Name of Wonder are they? In this
consists the great Mystery of State. If so,
then there is an end of our wondering.</p>

<p class='c006'>His Medicines are of two Sorts; one Set
of them published in a very small Book, tho’
there is a large Account of their <i>Virtues</i> and
<i>Uses</i>. There is a second Sort, which some
worthy Gentlemen of great Families, and
great Estates, have told us of, and these were
the <i>Secrets</i> of an eminent Physician. But
how do Gentlemen know Secrets in Physick?
It is not hard to guess who were chiefly concern’d
in their Information, and who have
made a goodly <i>Income</i> from a pretended <i>Inheritance</i>
to pretended <i>Secrets</i>. This is the
<i>Shrine</i> of the great <i>Diana</i>, to which every
Thing must not only submit, but for it every
other Shrine must be removed, even Truth it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>self; so that we may quickly hear of Doctor
<i>R——f</i>’s Secrets for the Plague, if it should
be the Will of God to send it us for a Punishment
of our Sins.</p>

<p class='c006'>How easy a Matter is it to become a great
Physician, but how difficult to a Man of
Education and Honour? Hence it is that we
find in all Times, tho’ never more than in the
present, that Physick is the common Resort
of all indigent Men, that no other Arts can
provide with a Living. Here Doctor <i>Rosary</i>
has made a better Market for his Beads, than
ever was in any <i>Roman Catholick Country</i>,
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Portugal</i> not excepted. At this
Time too, he is among the chief Writers on the
Plague, and with insufferable Assurance, dedicates
that Trifle to the <i>President</i> of the <i>College</i>
of <i>Physicians</i>, where, in the end, he tells
the World, how useful <i>his Necklace</i> is for the
<i>Plague</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Amulets</i>, indeed, have been in great
<i>Esteem</i> in Times of the Plague, and I hope
some great <i>Physician</i> will lend his Name to
one, that may frighten away this terrible
Disease.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
